                    I am currently a first year MLIS student at Simmons University in the School of Library and Information Science. I am interested in rare book and special collections librarianship, so my concentration at Simmons is in Cultural Heritage Informatics.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>My undergraduate degree was in Art History and East Asian Studies at Brandeis University. I graduated summa cum laude with high honors in art history.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>My interests within the field of art history are very diverse and range from Baroque sculpture to postwar Japanese calligraphy. Some of my favorite artists include Bernini, Titian, Claude Monet, Utagawa Kuniyoshi, and Morita Shiryu. In my free time you can find me refining my seal carving skills, doing Chinese hip-hop translations, or playing Genshin Impact.
